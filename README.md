# WindVersion
Development of an application designed to compare two versions of a document (PDFs) and detect subtle and significant changes between them. The goal is to efficiently identify variations in both form (paraphrases, structure) and content (added concepts, deleted information) with Mistral's 7B model.

## Key Features:
### Text Comparison: 
Detect and classify differences between two PDF versions. 
Automatically categorize changes into:
- Paraphrasing
- Additions
- Deletions
- Modifications

### Form and Content Detection: 
Separate changes in the structure and organization of text from the changes in its meaning and information.
